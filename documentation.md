*The Kung Fu of configuration files!*

**Kung-Fig** is a **wonderful** file format named **KFG**, its parser, its stringifier, and a set of great tools.

It is **great** for:

* Configuration files
* Hierarchical configuration files
* Global/local and vanilla/plugins override and extension management
* Application data
* Saving user prefs in a human-friendly format
* Building scripting language on top of it
* Game characters, weapons, armors, spells, etc, stats and bonus
* Internationalization/localization
* *... and many more*

Now, look at this **impressive** list of features:

* Human friendly data structure representation (similar to YAML)
* Comments support
* Multi-line strings support
* Constructors (date, binary data, regular expression, and custom constructors!)
* Including files (.kfg, .json, .js, .txt, etc), featuring globs and recursive parent search
* Inner and circular references support
* Tags (to build scripting language on top of KFG)
* References
* Template strings and internationalization/localization
* Expressions (arithmetic, logic, maths, etc)
* Tree operations (merge, combine, etc)
